## Exercise 1
1.function which take as input an integer p,a numeral n made up k digits and compute the sum of digit of n power p

2.function which takes as input p and return a list of p+5 element computed by i/(10**(i-1)) where i is index

3.unction which takes as input an integer p, a list l1 and return a list of bolean.if l1[i])<1/(9^p) the result is 1 and 0 else

4.program which create a list of 0 elements using i*(9^3) at index i

5.function loop which return the list of numeral forming the loop obtained while computing successive images by function f_p_n(n,p)

## Exercise 2
program which Given the list of test scores, produce a list associating each score with a rank (starting with 1 for the
highest score). Note that equal scores have the same rank.

## Exercise 3
program which compute pi from the first 20 terms of the Madhava series 

## Exercise 4
program which,given a list of integers l1 compute a list with the same lenght l2 in which l2[i] is the product of all the integers in l1 except l1[i] 

## Exercise 5
program which compute the square root of a number S with HERO'S method,compare with the "exact" value provided by the math.sqrt method and givethe value of n which the two results becomme the same

## Exercise 6
program which compute the fibonacci sequence's of an input number
